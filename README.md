Stroke Disease Diagnosis Application
Overview
This project aims to build a stroke diagnosis application using various machine learning algorithms. The application will analyze stroke data to provide insights and assist in diagnosis.

Machine Learning Algorithms
We will implement the following algorithms to build our predictive model:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
XGBoost (XGB)
Data Acquisition
The stroke dataset will be retrieved from Kaggle.
Data Analysis and Evaluation
Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Utilize Pandas to read and display the data.
Use Seaborn or Matplotlib for visualizations to analyze various features.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Check for and handle missing values.
Normalize and encode the data.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training and Evaluation
Step 1: Model Development
Use Scikit-learn to build and train the machine learning models.
Step 2: Model Evaluation
Assess model performance using metrics such as:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC.
